### First Steps and Examples

The online documentation has a [Getting Started](http://binjitsu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html) section for demonstrating some of the basic features.  More advanced use cases be found in the [write-ups](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-write-ups) repository, or [just by searching Google for `from pwn import *`](https://www.google.com/webhp#q=%22from+pwn+import%22)!

### Contributing and Source Control

Both `pwntools` and `binjitsu` use [Github](https://github.com) for source control and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com) for automatic testing.

Instructions on getting up and running with a local copy for development are available in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/binjitsu/binjitsu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for each project.
