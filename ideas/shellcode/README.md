### Porting Shellcode to Pwntools

Pwntools currently has a good deal of shellcode available in `pwnlib.shellcraft` for i386, amd64, and ARM.  However, there are lots of things that are missing (e.g. file-read, file-write, file descriptor proxying) which would be excellent additions to the corpus.

Porting shellcode to pwntools would require ingesting shellcode from Shell-Storm.org or ExploitDB.com, and re-writing them as Mako templates in pwntools.  Ideally, all shellcode will use (or be refactored to use) templates for common operations.
