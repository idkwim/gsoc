## More Exploit Examples!

There are easily hundreds of different exploits available [just from searching Google](https://www.google.com/webhp#q=%22from+pwn+import%22).
Unfortunately, these aren't all in one central location, and aren't being used to verify
that we're aware of any feature-breaking changes that we make.

This project would involve finding well-written exploits using `pwntools` 
(or re-writing other exploits to use it) and collecting them into the 
`pwntools-write-ups` repository.

After a good number are gathered and in working condition, a wrapper should
be developed to ensure that the exploits all work with a single command, so
that this can be integrated into the Continuous Integration tests.
