### Extend Integration Testing Framework and Examples

There is also a [regression testing][2] framework that's designed to permit automatic testing of various parts of pwntools as a whole, rather than in bite-sized prepared chunks.  This regression testing code works, but it is not complete and does not give good coverage for all of the code.

The current [examples repository][1] is a bit outdated and doesn't work with the current incarnation of pwntools or binjitsu.  Unfortunately, new users have very little options to turn to when looking for a good starting point for "How do I pwntools".
